# Developer Portal Controller

Developer Portal APIs and Controllers for Kubernetes-based API management.

## Overview

The Developer Portal Controller provides Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for managing API products and API keys in a developer portal ecosystem. It integrates with Kuadrant and Gateway API to provide a complete API lifecycle management solution.

## Custom Resources

### APIProduct

The `APIProduct` resource represents an API offering in the developer portal. It references an HTTPRoute and can include documentation, contact information, and usage plans.

#### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: devportal.kuadrant.io/v1alpha1
kind: APIProduct
metadata:
  name: toystore-api
  namespace: default
spec:
  displayName: "Toystore API"
  description: "A comprehensive API for managing toy inventory, orders, and customer data"
  version: "v1"
  approvalMode: manual
  publishStatus: Published
  tags:
    - retail
    - inventory
    - e-commerce
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io

```

#### APIProduct Spec Fields

- `displayName` (required): Human-readable name for the API product
- `description`: Detailed description of the API product
- `version`: API version (e.g., v1, v2)
- `approvalMode`: Whether access requests are auto-approved (`automatic`) or require manual review (`manual`)
- `publishStatus`: Controls visibility in the catalog (`Draft` or `Published`)
- `tags`: List of tags for categorization and search
- `targetRef`: Reference to the HTTPRoute that this API product represents
- `documentation`: API documentation links (OpenAPI spec, Swagger UI, docs URL, git repository, techdocs)
- `contact`: Contact information for API owners (team, email, Slack, URL)

#### APIProduct Status Fields

---

### APIKey

The `APIKey` resource represents a developer's request for API access. It includes information about the requester, the desired plan tier, and the use case.

#### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: devportal.kuadrant.io/v1alpha1
kind: APIKey
metadata:
  name: toystore-apikey
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: developer-portal-controller
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
spec:
  apiProductRef:
    name: toystore-api
  planTier: gold
  useCase: "Authentication key for our Toystore API integration"
  requestedBy:
    userId: user-12345
    email: developer@example.com
status:
  phase: Approved
  apiHostname: api.example.com
  reviewedBy: admin@example.com
  reviewedAt: "2025-12-09T10:30:00Z"
  limits:
    daily: 1000
  secretRef:
    name: toystore-apikey-secret
    key: api-key
  canReadSecret: true
  conditions:
    - type: Ready
      status: "True"
      reason: APIKeyReady
      message: APIKey has been approved and secret created
      lastTransitionTime: "2025-12-09T10:30:00Z"
```

- `apiHostname`: Hostname from the HTTPRoute
- `reviewedBy`: Who approved or rejected the request
- `reviewedAt`: Timestamp when the request was reviewed

  - `key`: Key within the secret
- `canReadSecret`: Permission to read the APIKey's secret (default: true)
- `conditions`: Latest observations of the APIKey's state

## Development environment setup

Dev env

```bash
make kind-create-cluster
make install
make gateway-api-install
make kuadrant-core-install
```

Deploy controller

```bash
make local-deploy
```

## Usage

### Creating an APIProduct

1. Create an HTTPRoute for your API
2. Create a PlanPolicy to define rate limits and tiers
3. Create an APIProduct referencing the HTTPRoute

### Requesting an APIKey

1. Create an APIKey resource referencing the APIProduct
2. If `approvalMode` is `manual`, wait for approval
3. Once approved, the secret will be created with the API key
4. Use the key from the secret to authenticate API requests

## kubectl Commands

```bash
# List APIProducts
kubectl get apiproducts

# List APIKeys (shortname: apik)
kubectl get apik

# View APIKey details with phase and plan
kubectl get apik -o wide

# Describe an APIKey to see status details
kubectl describe apikey toystore-apikey
```
